# Reusable Workflows Testing

This repo tests usages of two re-usable workflows.

- [one](.github/workflows/standard_location.yaml) in the standard location the [github docs say to use](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_iduses)
- [one](non_standard_location.yaml) in a non-standard location to test that that works as well
